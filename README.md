The group that patronizes more is the group under 36.

Discount-sensitive customers pay more when products are discounted.

Customers that purchase office supplies are most likely to use express shipping while animal feed uses standard shipping predominantly.
The peak shipping day is Tuesday.
Social media influence significantly affects the purchase amount.
Social media influence does not affect the product rating.
Products with low ratings do not have a high return rate.
Travel and Leisure (flights) have the highest return rate.

**Recommendations**
1. Use a high social media influence.
2. Social media should focus more on the age group that is below 36 since they purchase the most.
3. Discounts should be given more to middle-income earners since they use them more than high-income earners.
4. The company should concentrate on promoting groceries since groceries have the lowest return rate.
